The solution involves understanding and applying CSS specificity correctly. There are multiple ways to solve this issue: 

**Method 1: Prioritize Specificity:** Ensure that your most specific selectors are placed later in your CSS file. This ensures that the intended styles are applied.  With the provided selectors, the more specific style should be last:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red; 
}

#special-id div {
  color: green;
}

#special-id .special-class div {
  color: purple;
}
```

**Method 2: Consolidate Selectors:** If possible, combine selectors to reduce ambiguity. For example, you might change your approach to target the element directly with its full class and id combination and remove duplicate code. This improves readability and reduces potential conflicts.

**Method 3: Use !important (use cautiously):** As a last resort, the `!important` flag can override specificity. However, overuse of `!important` can make your CSS harder to maintain and debug.  It's generally best to avoid this approach if possible and prefer methods 1 or 2.
