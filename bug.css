The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red; 
}

#special-id div {
  color: green;
}

#special-id .special-class div {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this scenario, the `#special-id .special-class div` selector is highly specific and will override the other selectors because it uses a combination of ID and class selectors.  However, if the order of selectors is changed in your CSS file, you may unexpectedly see different colors rendered due to the order of CSS rules and specificity.  This can be very difficult to debug because the change doesn't appear to be related to the code itself, but to the order of your CSS declarations.
